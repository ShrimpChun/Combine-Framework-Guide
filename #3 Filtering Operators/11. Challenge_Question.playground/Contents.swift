 Challenge: Filter all the things
 
 Create an example that publishers a collection of numbers from 1 to 100, and use filtering operators to:
 
 1. Skip the first 50 values emmited by the upstream publisher.
 2. Take the next 20 values after those first 50 values.
 3. Only take even numbers.
 
 The output of your example should produce the following numbers, one per line:
 52 54 56 58 60 62 64 66 68 70
